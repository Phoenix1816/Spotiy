Spotiy is a Windows-based music application developed using the .NET 10 framework and MySQL.
It allows users to sign up, log in, listen to music, manage favorite songs, and edit their profiles.
Artists can upload songs and manage their content, while administrators can manage users by banning or unbanning accounts.
The application uses a role-based system and a structured database design to ensure security, usability, and data integrity.
